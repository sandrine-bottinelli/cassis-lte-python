# cassis-lte-python

## About the project

The goal of this project is to provide python scripts 
to perform LTE modeling using the same philosophy
as in [CASSIS](http://cassis.irap.omp.eu).

## Getting started

Make sure that cassis-lte-python is in your PYTHONPATH.

To use your own settings :
- duplicate the config_defaults.ini
file in the cassis_lte_python directory,
- rename it 'config.ini' 
- edit it as necessary.

Example scripts for model creation are provided,
along with expected outputs : 
- ltm_example.py : generates a single model with one component and two species.
- ltm_example_grid1.py : computes models with one component for a grid of parameters.
- ltm_example_grid2.py : computes models with two components for a grid of parameters.
